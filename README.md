Learn the main ideas involved in developing a DataLake using InterSystems IRIS.

# Learn the basics
ðŸ‘‰ We will combine different features of InterSystems IRIS such as multi-model database, interoperability and analytics.

If you are not too familiar with InterSystems IRIS technology, you can get a hands-on overview with these resources:
* Learn about InterSystems IRIS and **Docker containers** - [workshop-containers-intro](https://github.com/intersystems-ib/workshop-containers-intro)
* Learn how to use InterSystems IRIS and Visual Studio Code - [workshop-vscode-iris](https://github.com/intersystems-ib/workshop-vscode-iris)
* A very simple introduction to InterSystems IRIS **multi-model database** -  [workshop-multimodel-intro](https://github.com/intersystems-ib/workshop-multimodel-intro)
* An overview of **interoperability** using IRIS - [workshop-interop-intro](https://github.com/intersystems-ib/workshop-interop-intro)
* Analytics & BI in a nutshell with IRIS - [workshop-iris-bi-intro](https://github.com/intersystems-ib/workshop-iris-bi-intro)

# What do you need to install? 
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (if you are using Windows, make sure you set your Docker installation to use "Linux containers").
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) + [InterSystems ObjectScript VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=daimor.vscode-objectscript)

# Setup
Clone the GitHub repository to your local computer. This will allow you to acces the code and build the samples:
```
git clone https://github.com/intersystems-ib/workshop-iris-datalake
``` 

Build the image we will use during the workshop:
```
docker-compose build
```

# Data model
```

```
